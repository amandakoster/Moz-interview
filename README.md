Detailed Project Information:
1. Main technologies:
* Node
* Superagent
* React
* Babel
* Sass

2. How to start this project:
You will find the dependencies listed in the package.json file.  To install these packages with yarn, in terminal 


3. I have created a sortable table using the API data. The table shows 5 columns for:
* Job title
* Average female wage
* Average male wage
* Wage Gap: $ Difference
* Wage Gap: % Percentage

4. Where I got stuck:

I chose to build the table 'from scratch' using React. I'd like to complete the on my own and use a library such as tablreact-table, react-bootstrap-table or Victory: http://victory.formidable.com to build the entire table as it became unnecessarily time-consuming to borrow specific features from a library for a table built from scratch in React.

Incomplete: filtering and pagination.
